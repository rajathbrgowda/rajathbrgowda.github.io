									<p>I am a Graduate student at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b> pursuing a Master's Program in Electrical and Computer Engineering expected to graduate in May 2023.

										My current interests lie broadly in the intersection of Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Perception.
										 I have four years of professional work experience in a state owned Electronics Design and Manufacturing company, where I worked as a Design and Development Engineer.
										I had the opportunity to work on several challenging projects from two major development teams that were a part of the company’s core technologies.
										</p>
										<p>
											Through my Master's, I have focussed majority of my coursework in the areas of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I have taken courses in Deep Learning and Estimation, Detection and Learning.
											My current course's include Visual earning and Recognition, Machine Learning for Signal Processing and Deep Learning for Robotics .
										</p>
										<p>
											I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at LTI, School of Computer Science. I am advised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.
											My research is focussed on Learning strategies for unsupervised adaptations of test data to bridge the distribution gap in test and train data 
											so as to improve classification accuracy.



										</p>


										<p>

											During my first semester, I worked as a Research Assistant with Prof. Yang Cai, at the <b><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/vis/research.html">Visual Intel Studio, CyLab</a></b>.
											My Work involved Research, design, and developement of  ‘Emergency Medical Service’ project to provide Simulated Medical
											Training of Laryngoscopy.
										</p>
										<p>
											Excellent teaching by <b><a href="http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/">Prof. Bhiksha Raj</a></b> and intensive curriculum of the Deep Learning Course Inspired me to undertake a Teaching 
											Assistantship during the Fall-2022 Semester.

											I contributed towards curriculum design, assignment drafting, and course planning.
											My work involved preparation and presentation of lectures and recitations, conducting office hours, supporting term projects, helping/mentoring students with course materials,
											grading assignments, and quizzes in classes totaling over 350 students.
										</p>
										
										
										<p>
											Prior to CMU, I worked as a Design and Development Engineer at <b>Bharat Electronics Limited, Bangalore, India</b>.I worked for two years in the Simulator Development group, where I contributed towards development of three Virtual Reality based Commercial
											 Simulators that were used for hazard perception and training purposes. Some of my key contributions include implementation of - fully immersive and interactive
											  3D visual systems, vehicle dynamics, realistic imitation of cabin controls, traffic and crowd simulation, integration of HTC Vive VR head mount device, 
											  Leap motion tracking device and 3 Degree of Freedom motion platform. 
											  I have extensive hands-on work experience in Unity3D game engine and am proficient in scripting, game physics,  particle systems, crowd simulation module, working with game assets, Unity Navigation, VR locomotion, Leap motion hand tracking, gesture recognition and VR interaction toolkit.
										</p>
										<p>
											Following this, I got an opportunity to contribute towards Research and Development of an indigenously developed
											  Autonomous Marine Defence System  such as Anti-torpedo/rocket countermeasure
											  systems. My work involved interfacing a compendium of sensors to provide multi-sensor track correlation and
											  track management of surface and underwater targets to generate an accurate fire control solution using Deep Learning.
											   I Designed an HMI for predicting Azimuth and Elevation angles for target engagement from ship-borne robotic Fire distribution Rocket and Torpedo launchers.
											   Introduced and executed an extensible software called “External Simulator Interface” to provide Naval Tactical Simulation of sensors such as Active/Passive Sonar, Radar that predict underwater targets using Deep Learning that reduced integration time.
											   I extensively worked on design of the high-fidelity software to provide an intuitive
											    graphic user-interface to facilitate a comprehensive and realistic naval training experience.</p>
												<p>
												 With the concentration of industrial and R&D opportunities that I’ve garnered through my career, I have been proficient in both programming and hardware design and implementation.
